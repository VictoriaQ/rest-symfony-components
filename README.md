Code example using Symfony Components to create a RESTful API. Created for the talk "Building a RESTful APIs with Symfony Components", given at PHP UK Conference (Feb. 16th., 2017).

It can be considered a very basic implementation of a tiny framework -only for educational purposes and with no single advantage over any real framework out there.
